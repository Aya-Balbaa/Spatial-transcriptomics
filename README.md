# Spatial-transcriptomics
The data was extracted from microglia on the plaque, in the peri-plaque region and away from the plaque. Astrocytes data was extracted from around the plaques and away from the plaques
because there was no astrocytes on the plaque. 
The data is coming from two mouse models for Alzheimer's disease, NLF which develops plaques and NLFTrem2R47H.
TREM2R47H is a loss of function mutation for the microglial gene Trem2.
The main aim of this experiment is to find how the loss of Trem2 function in microglia influence its response to plaques.
